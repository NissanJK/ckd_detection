Data Dictionary for CKD Dataset

Column Name      | Type         | Possible Values            | Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
age              | Numerical    | Any non-negative number    | Age of the patient in years.
bp               | Numerical    | Any non-negative number    | Blood pressure in mmHg (diastolic).
sg               | Numerical    | 1.005 - 1.030              | Specific gravity of urine (density of urine compared to water).
al               | Numerical    | 0 - 5                      | Albumin levels in urine (0 = none, 1-5 = increasing severity).
bgr              | Numerical    | Any non-negative number    | Blood glucose random (mg/dL).
sc               | Numerical    | Any non-negative number    | Serum creatinine levels (mg/dL).
hemo             | Numerical    | Any non-negative number    | Hemoglobin levels (g/dL).
htn              | Categorical  | 0 = No, 1 = Yes            | Presence of hypertension (high blood pressure).
dm               | Categorical  | 0 = No, 1 = Yes            | Presence of diabetes mellitus.
ane              | Categorical  | 0 = No, 1 = Yes            | Presence of anemia.
classification   | Categorical  | 0 = Not CKD, 1 = CKD       | Final classification of the patient (Chronic Kidney Disease or Not CKD).

How the Columns Relate to CKD:
- age: Older patients are more likely to develop CKD.
- bp: High blood pressure is a significant risk factor for CKD.
- sg: Lower specific gravity indicates poor kidney function.
- al: Higher albumin levels indicate kidney damage.
- bgr: High blood glucose levels are linked to diabetes, a major CKD risk factor.
- sc: Elevated serum creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function.
- hemo: Low hemoglobin levels are common in CKD due to reduced erythropoietin production.
- htn: Hypertension accelerates kidney damage.
- dm: Diabetes is the leading cause of CKD.
- ane: Anemia is a common complication of CKD.
- classification: The target column for prediction.
