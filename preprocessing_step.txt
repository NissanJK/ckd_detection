 Data Preprocessing Steps for CKD Prediction

 1. Data Encoding
- Assign "1" to positive values: 'yes', 'ckd', 'normal', 'present', 'good'.
- Assign "0" to negative values: 'no', 'notckd', 'abnormal', 'notpresent', 'poor'.

 2. Handling Missing Data
- Remove rows with more than "40% missing values".
- Drop the 'id' column.

 3. Feature Selection

 a. Correlation Analysis
- Find how strongly each feature is related to the target variable ('classification').
- Keep features with a correlation above "0.3".

 b. Statistical/ML-Based Feature Selection
- Use methods like:
  - "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)".
  - "Random Forest" to rank features by importance.

 c. Domain Knowledge
- Keep clinically important features even if their correlation is low.

 Example of Final Features:
- "age"
- "bp"
- "sg"
- "al"
- "bgr"
- "sc"
- "hemo"
- "htn"
- "dm"
- "ane"
- "classification" (target variable)

 4. Handling Missing Values

 a. Basic Imputation
- Fill missing numbers (e.g., 'age', 'bp') with the "median".
- Fill missing categories (e.g., 'htn', 'dm') with the "most common value (mode)".

 b. KNN Imputation
- Use "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)" for missing numbers.
- Replace missing values by looking at similar rows.
- Maintains relationships between features.

These steps clean and prepare the dataset for building and testing machine learning models.
