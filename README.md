# CKD Detection Project

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on clinical and laboratory features. The dataset includes critical health metrics like blood pressure, glucose levels, and hemoglobin to identify CKD in individuals.

## Features

- Preprocessed dataset with key features for CKD prediction.
- Machine learning models, including XGBoost, for high accuracy.
- Automated hyperparameter tuning using `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- Confusion matrix visualization for model evaluation.
- Clean and professional UI for visualizing healthy vs. infected kidneys.
